# Venticks Project - AI Coding Instructions

## Project Overview

Venticks is a new project. This file should be updated as the codebase evolves to reflect actual patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions.

## Getting Started

- **Repository**: https://github.com/0xedev/venticks.git
- Update this section with setup instructions once dependencies and tooling are established

## Architecture & Structure

Document here:

- Main application components and their responsibilities
- Data flow between services/modules
- Key design patterns in use

## Development Workflow

Document here:

- Build commands (e.g., `npm run build`, `cargo build`)
- Test commands and testing strategy
- Local development setup steps
- Debug configurations

## Code Conventions

Document here:

- Naming conventions for files, functions, classes
- Error handling patterns
- Logging/observability approach
- Code organization principles

## Key Integration Points

Document here:

- External APIs and services
- Database schema and migration strategy
- Authentication/authorization patterns
- Third-party libraries and their usage

## Common Patterns & Examples

Document here with file references:

- How to add a new feature (with example file paths)
- How to write tests (with example test file)
- How to handle configuration (with example config file)

## Important Context

Document here:

- Tricky areas that need special attention
- Performance considerations
- Security best practices specific to this project
- Known limitations or workarounds
